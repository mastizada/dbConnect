Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of dbConnect.


Distribute & Pip
----------------

Installing dbConnect is simple with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_, just run
this in your terminal::

or, with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::

    $ easy_install dbConnect

But, you really `shouldn't do that <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install>`_.

`always available <https://github.com/EmiXLabs/dbConnect>`_.
